			<h1 className="bigTitle">Technology and Engineering Club</h1>
			<p>
				Our goal is to encourage and progress your education in technology and
				engineering (STEM) concepts in a hands-on and interactive way. We
				challenge and encourage our members in developing and creating projects
				of their choice, while utilizing our materials and guidance. And along
				the way, we make new friends and develop team buildings skills!
			</p>
			<p>
				In TEC, you can focus on an independent project of your choice,
				participate in group challenges, teach mini lessons to your peers, join
				TSA, and so much more!

				Click through our website to see what we have done together, and what we
				can do together in the future!
